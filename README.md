## EX1
> **Set up a bayesian modelling workflow for a synthetic burnout dataset generated by you**
>>Here's an outline of a Bayesian modeling workflow for a synthetic burnout dataset:
>>+ 1-Generate a synthetic dataset that simulates burnout levels in a group of individuals. This could include variables such as demographic information (age, gender, occupation, etc.), work-related factors (hours worked per week, job stress, etc.), and burnout measures (such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory).
>>+ 2-Choose a Bayesian modeling framework, such as PyMC3 or Stan.
>>+ 3-Determine the appropriate model structure for the data. For example, you could use a hierarchical model to account for any potential group-level effects, or a multivariate model to examine the relationships between multiple burnout measures.
>>+ 4-Specify the priors for the model parameters, such as normal distributions for continuous variables and categorical distributions for categorical variables.
>>+ 5-Run the model and check for convergence using techniques such as the Gelman-Rubin statistic or visual inspection of trace plots.
>>+ 6-Interpret the posterior distributions of the model parameters to make inferences about the relationships between the variables in the dataset. This can include calculating credible intervals, generating predictions, and creating visualizations such as posterior plots and correlation plots.
>>+ 7-Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as predictive log-likelihood or cross-validation.
>>+ 8-Iterate and improve the model as needed by repeating steps 3-7, for example by adding new variables, changing the prior distributions, or trying different model structures.

Keep in mind this is a general workflow and specifics can vary depending on the complexity of the dataset, specific question and the modelling framework of your choice.
> **Create a small dataset on above**
>> Sure, here's an example of a small synthetic dataset that simulates burnout levels in a group of individuals:
```Python
ID, Age, Gender, Occupation, Hours_worked_per_week, Job_stress, Emotional_exhaustion, Depersonalization, Personal_accomplishment
1, 32, Male, Engineer, 55, High, 3, 2, 4
2, 25, Female, Teacher, 45, Medium, 2, 1, 5
3, 40, Male, Lawyer, 60, High, 4, 3, 3
4, 28, Female, Nurse, 50, Low, 1, 1, 5
5, 35, Male, Salesperson, 55, Medium, 3, 2, 4
6, 30, Female, IT professional, 55, High, 4, 3, 3
7, 26, Male, Accountant, 50, Medium, 2, 2, 4
8, 39, Female, HR professional, 45, Low, 1, 1, 5
9, 31, Male, Marketing professional, 60, High, 3, 3, 3
10, 27, Female, Researcher, 40, Low, 1, 2, 5
```
This dataset includes the following variables:

+ ID: A unique identifier for each individual
+ Age: The age of the individual
+ Gender: The gender of the individual (Male or Female)
+ Occupation: The occupation of the individual
+ Hours_worked_per_week: The number of hours worked per week by the individual
+ Job_stress: The perceived stress level on the job (High, Medium, or Low)
+ Emotional_exhaustion: A score on a scale of 1-5 measuring emotional exhaustion (1 = Low, 5 = High)
+ Depersonalization: A score on a scale of 1-5 measuring depersonalization (1 = Low, 5 = High)
+ Personal_accomplishment: A score on a scale of 1-5 measuring personal accomplishment (1 = Low, 5 = High)
It's a small dataset but it can give you an idea how you can create a dataset like this and you can add more variables according to your research question.

> **Give the python code for setting up a simple bayesian workflow on above dataset**
>> Here's an example of a simple Bayesian workflow for the synthetic burnout dataset using the PyMC3 library:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pymc3 as pm

# Read in the synthetic burnout dataset
df = pd.read_csv('burnout_dataset.csv')

# Convert the Job_stress variable to a categorical variable
df['Job_stress'] = pd.Categorical(df['Job_stress'])

# Specify the model
with pm.Model() as burnout_model:
    # Define the priors
    mu_age = pm.Normal('mu_age', mu=30, sigma=10)
    sigma_age = pm.HalfNormal('sigma_age', 10)
    mu_hours = pm.Normal('mu_hours', mu=50, sigma=10)
    sigma_hours = pm.HalfNormal('sigma_hours', 10)
    mu_emotional_exhaustion = pm.Normal('mu_emotional_exhaustion', mu=2.5, sigma=1)
    sigma_emotional_exhaustion = pm.HalfNormal('sigma_emotional_exhaustion', 1)
    mu_depersonalization = pm.Normal('mu_depersonalization', mu=2.5, sigma=1)
    sigma_depersonalization = pm.HalfNormal('sigma_depersonalization', 1)
    mu_personal_accomplishment = pm.Normal('mu_personal_accomplishment', mu=4, sigma=1)
    sigma_personal_accomplishment = pm.HalfNormal('sigma_personal_accomplishment', 1)
    alpha_job_stress = pm.Normal('alpha_job_stress', mu=0, sigma=1)
    
    # Define the likelihood
    age = pm.Normal('age', mu=mu_age, sigma=sigma_age, observed=df['Age'])
    hours_worked = pm.Normal('hours_worked', mu=mu_hours, sigma=sigma_hours, observed=df['Hours_worked_per_week'])
    emotional_exhaustion = pm.Normal('emotional_exhaustion', mu=mu_emotional_exhaustion, sigma=sigma_emotional_exhaustion, observed=df['Emotional_exhaustion'])
    depersonalization = pm.Normal('depersonalization', mu=mu_depersonalization, sigma=sigma_depersonalization, observed=df['Depersonalization'])
    personal_accomplishment = pm.Normal('personal_accomplishment', mu=mu_personal_accomplishment, sigma=sigma_personal_accomplishment, observed=df['Personal_accomplishment'])
    job_stress = pm.Categorical('job_stress', p=pm.math.softmax(alpha_job_stress), observed=df['Job_stress'].cat.codes)
    
    # Run the inference
    trace = pm.sample(3000, tune=1000, chains=2)
